\begin{abstract}
  Music has always been an integral part of society. With all recent innovations in interfaces, information retrieval and artificial intelligence, we are faced with the question: "What is the future of music? How will we consume music a hundred years from now?" In this paper, we will present - how music has been consumed throughout history - and what we imagined as to how music will be a century from now. We will make wild predictions about the future of music and its interface, and encourage discussion regarding these visions.

\section{Introduction}
%Humans have been listening to music since 
% styles and types of music 
% instruments
% recent innovations in music, IR, AI 

\section{Background}
%paragraph 1: Humans instint of safety and the role of music 
%paragraph 2: trends of how music instruments have evolved

\section{Re-imagining the music interface}
% paragraph 1: music an experience that you can be immersed in without losing touch of reality

% music comes from emotions and we create music to retain, continue experiencing these emotions

\section{Design Scenarios}
% scenario : swimming in corals/alone in the forest. describe tech. add photos

% scenario: algorithms that easily convert our emotion stimuli into actual music

% discovering new music 
\section{Conclusion}

\section{Figures}

The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
in the example below.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
  \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
    Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
    Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
  \Description{The 1907 Franklin Model D roadster.}
\end{figure}

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
the reader. Figure captions go below the figure. Your figures should
{\bfseries also} include a description suitable for screen readers, to
assist the visually-challenged to better understand your work.

Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.

\subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}

A ``teaser figure'' is an image, or set of images in one figure, that
are placed after all author and affiliation information, and before
the body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
\verb|\maketitle| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{teaserfigure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
    \caption{figure caption}
    \Description{figure description}
  \end{teaserfigure}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Citations and Bibliographies}

The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
--- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
(``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
article DOI, etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
  \bibliography{bibfile}
\end{verbatim}
where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.

Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before
``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
\begin{verbatim}
  \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
\end{verbatim}


%%
%% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and
%% the bibliography file.
\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\bibliography{sample-base}
\nocite{*}

\end{document}
\endinput
%%
%% End of file `sample-acmtog.tex'.
